\section{Basic equation}
\subsection{Substantial derivative}
\hspace{5mm}
$\frac{D}{Dt}$ is called the substantial derivative. $\frac{D\rho}{Dt}$ is the instantaneous time rate of change of density of the fluid element as it moves through a point. Here our eyes are locked on the fluid element as it is moving, and we are watching the density change of the element as it moves through the point. \par
This is different from $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$, which is physically the time rate of change of density at the fixed point. \par
$\frac{D\rho}{Dt}$ and $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$ are physically and numerically different quantities. \par
Here we show the definition of $\frac{D}{Dt}$. If we have
$$
\rho_{1} = \rho_{1}(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, t_{1})
$$
$$
\rho_{2} = \rho_{2}(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}, t_{2})
$$
Then we calculate that
\begin{equation}
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = \lim_{t_{1} \to t_{2}}\frac{\rho_{2}-\rho_{1}}{t_{1}-t_{2}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial }{\partial t}+\vec{v}\cdot \nabla
\end{equation}
The first part is the local derivative and the second part is the convective derivative.\par
The substantial derivative is essentially the total derivative from calculus. For example:
$$
d\rho = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}dt+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}dz
$$
$$
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = \frac{d \rho}{d t} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}\frac{dz}{dt}
$$



\subsection{Conservation of mass}
\hspace{5mm} We consider the finite control volume (here we consider that the CV is fixed in space, which means the shape of the volume is unchanged).\par
Mass is conserved: \textbf{Net mass flow out of the control volume through surface $S$ is equal to the time rate of decrease of mass inside the control volume $V$}.\par
The mass flux across a surface element $d\vec{S}$ is:
$$
\rho\vec{v}\cdot d\vec{S}
$$
The net mass flow out of control volume is:
$$
\iint_{S}\rho\vec{v}\cdot d\vec{S}
$$
The total mass inside the control volume is:
$$
\iiint_{V} \rho dV
$$
Since we consider the fixed control volume, the time rate of increase of mass inside the CV $V$ is then:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint_{V} \rho dV
$$Note that the time rate of decrease is negative, while the net mass flux out is positive. When considering conservation, we should make the sign correct.\par
Thus we have the conservation of mass:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint_{V} \rho dV + \iint_{S}\rho\vec{v}\cdot d\vec{S} = 0
\end{equation}\par
Now we consider the control volume moving with the fluid. The control volume is always made up of the same fluid particles as it moves with the flow. The mass is fixed, but the volume $V$ and the control surface $S$ is always changing.\par
The total mass of the finite control volume is:
$$
M = \iiint_{\Omega} \rho d\Omega
$$
The volume integral is taken over the whole moving control volume $\Omega$. But the control volume is changing as the control volume moves downstream.\par
Since the mass $M$ is constant, it doesn't change with time, mathematically:
$$
\frac{dM}{dt} = 0
$$\par
Here we use the form of the substantial derivative:
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} \iiint_{\Omega} \rho d\Omega =0
\end{equation}
Again, we get the integral form of the continuity equation (nonconservation form). We have obtained the \textbf{integral} form of the continuity equation in two different ways. Now we are trying to get the \textbf{differential} form also in two different ways. Note that it is not a simple transfer from the integral to differential mathematically. \par
This time, we don't consider the finite control volume $V$ but an infinitesimally small element $dxdydz$ (fixed in space).\par
The Net mass flux for the infinitesimally small element in $x$ is:
$$
\left[ \rho u + \frac{\partial \rho u}{\partial x}dx\right] \cdot dydz 
-(\rho u) dydz = \frac{\partial \rho u}{\partial x}dxdydz
$$
$$
\left[ \rho v + \frac{\partial \rho v}{\partial y}dx\right] \cdot dxdz 
-(\rho v) dxdz = \frac{\partial \rho v}{\partial y}dxdydz
$$
$$
\left[ \rho w + \frac{\partial \rho w}{\partial z}dz\right] \cdot dydx 
-(\rho w) dydx = \frac{\partial \rho w}{\partial z}dxdydz
$$As a result, the total net mass flow is:
$$
\left[\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial (\rho v)}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial (\rho w)}{\partial z}\right]dxdydz
$$\par
The time rate of mass is:
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}dxdydz
$$\par
Finally, we get the differential form of the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} +\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial (\rho v)}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial (\rho w)}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} +\nabla \cdot(\rho \vec{v})=0
$$\par
The moving control volume mode. The mass of the infinitesimally small fluid element is:
$$
\delta m = \rho \delta \Omega
$$
Since the mass is conserved, we have:
$$
\frac{D (\delta m)}{Dt} = \frac{D (\rho \delta \Omega)}{Dt}= 0
$$
The derivative by part allows us to get:
$$
\frac{D \rho}{Dt} + \frac{\rho}{\delta \Omega}\cdot\frac{D ( \delta \Omega)}{Dt}= 0
$$\par
The volume can be calculated as:
$$
\delta \Omega = \iint_{\delta S}\vec{v}dS \cdot \delta t
$$
$$
\frac{D ( \delta \Omega)}{Dt} =\lim_{\delta t \to 0} \frac{\delta \Omega}{\delta t}=\lim_{\delta s \to 0}\iint_{\delta S}\vec{v}dS =\lim_{\delta \Omega \to 0}\iiint_{\delta \Omega} (\nabla \cdot \vec{v})d \Omega = (\nabla \cdot \vec{v})\delta \Omega
$$\par
As a result, we find another form of the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{D \rho}{Dt} + \rho  (\nabla \cdot \vec{v})= 0
\end{equation}
Note that
$$
\frac{D \rho}{Dt} + \rho  (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}) = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot\nabla \rho + \rho  (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}) = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot(\rho \vec{v})=0
$$
